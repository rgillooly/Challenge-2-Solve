GOAL: 
To complete a website to display employee credentials in the form of a mock-up.

USAGE:
No pre-requisites to use.



This site includes several elements.

There is a navbar, which will take you to each entry.
Each of these is header and a picture link.
These links take you to two websites, each of which I have made.
One is a personal resume website, for self promotion.
The other is a website I made for my family's business.
Both these websites are hosted via github pages.
All links on both sites should work.
